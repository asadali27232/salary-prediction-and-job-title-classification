# Salary Prediction and Job Title Classification

This repository contains a Python script that predicts salary ranges and classifies job titles based on given features. The script uses machine learning algorithms such as linear regression and random forest classification from the scikit-learn library.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   `git clone https://github.com/your-username/salary-prediction-and-job-title-classification.git`

2. Install the required dependencies:
   `pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tabulate`

3. Prepare the data:
   - Ensure that the dataset file named "salary_data_cleaned.csv" is in the same directory as the script.
   - Modify the script if needed to match the column names and data structure of your dataset.

4. Run the script:
   `python salary_prediction.py`

5. Follow the prompts to provide the required input values for age, Python skills, R skills, Spark skills, AWS skills, and Excel skills.

6. View the predicted job title and salary range in the console output.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this script is stored in the file "salary_data_cleaned.csv". It contains relevant columns such as job title, age, Python skills, R skills, Spark skills, AWS skills, Excel skills, and salary information.
